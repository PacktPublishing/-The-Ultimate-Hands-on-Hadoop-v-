# The Ultimate Hands-on Hadoop [Video]
This is the code repository for [The Ultimate Hands-on Hadoop [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/exploratory-data-analysis-pandas-and-python-3x-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789959116), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The world of Hadoop and "Big Data" can be intimidating - hundreds of different technologies with cryptic names form the Hadoop ecosystem. With this course, you'll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together - but you'll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!This course is comprehensive, covering over 25 different technologies in over 14 hours of video lectures. It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises, so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords, there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines, we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer, I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using Scala, Pig Latin, and Python.
